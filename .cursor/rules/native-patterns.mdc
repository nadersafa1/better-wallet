# React Native/Expo Patterns

## Expo Router Structure
- Use Expo Router for navigation
- Follow the layout structure in [apps/native/app/_layout.tsx](mdc:apps/native/app/_layout.tsx)
- Use drawer and tab navigation patterns from existing layouts

## Component Patterns
- Use NativeWind for styling (Tailwind CSS for React Native)
- Follow component patterns from [apps/native/components/sign-in.tsx](mdc:apps/native/components/sign-in.tsx)
- Use React Native components with Tailwind classes

## Authentication
- Use Better Auth with Expo support
- Follow auth client setup in [apps/native/lib/auth-client.ts](mdc:apps/native/lib/auth-client.ts)
- Use Expo Secure Store for token storage

## tRPC Integration
- Use tRPC client with React Query
- Follow setup in [apps/native/utils/trpc.ts](mdc:apps/native/utils/trpc.ts)
- Handle loading and error states properly

## File Organization
- App routes in `app/` directory (Expo Router)
- Components in `components/`
- Utilities in `utils/` or `lib/`
- Assets in `assets/`

## Navigation
- Use drawer navigation for main app structure
- Use tab navigation for main sections
- Follow existing navigation patterns in the app directory
