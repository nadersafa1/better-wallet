# Development Workflow

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all files
- Use arrow functions for components
- Do not use semicolons
- Use single quotes for strings
- Use 2 spaces for indentation

## Database Development
- Use `npm run db:start` to start PostgreSQL with Docker
- Use `npm run db:studio` to open Drizzle Studio
- Use `npm run db:push` to push schema changes
- Use `npm run db:generate` to generate migrations
- UUID generation should be handled by database server

## Type Safety
- Infer types from tRPC returns rather than creating new interfaces
- Use Zod for runtime validation
- Leverage TypeScript's type inference capabilities

## State Management
- Use Zustand for client state (never Context API)
- Use React Query for server state
- Keep state as close to where it's used as possible

## Testing
- Write tests for critical business logic
- Test authentication flows
- Test form validation
- Test tRPC endpoints

## Performance
- Use React Query for caching and background updates
- Optimize bundle size with proper imports
- Use proper loading states and error boundaries
